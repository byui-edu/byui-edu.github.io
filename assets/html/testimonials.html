                "Marvis Igbineweka was hired as a Full Stack Developer Intern at Brigham Young University Idaho in the
                CIT Department in the month of April 2022. He worked for the department for three months. I was very
                impressed with Marvisâ€™ ability to work with others. Marvis was not afraid to speak up and raise his
                opinion to the team about their technical direction. In addition, he has very good CSS, HTML, and Web
                Design skills. Marvis is also learning React Native and has a good Javascript foundation. I am grateful
                for Marvis and the time he spent as an intern at BYUI. I would recommend him to anyone." <span
