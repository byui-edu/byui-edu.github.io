        <p class="info">My love for programming started at my very young age I was in my early years in High School, when i discovered how fascinating computers are when dealing with <a href="#">communication and information processing</a>. I got more and more into computers as i moved up in classes and development levels as computers became available to me. I then decided to buy a <strong>personal computer</strong> of my own so i would have one readily available to me at all times. <br> I was curious as to what more i could do with my <strong>PC</strong> other than just some microsoft word and Corel drawing. I found out that computers can be given commands as to what to display on screen for audiences using not MS word, but a software that deals with codes and computer languages. I then decided that i would want to learn and know how that is done. <br>That is how i started my journey in learn <a href="#">basic HTML and CSS</a> on my own while i carry on with my High School classes. To be honest, i could not wait to graduate from High School and learn this art for real in a university with good and available resources. <br>
            After my graduation i moved to the United States to further my education in <a href="#">Web design and development</a>, i felt comfortable moving here as i was moving to study in a university belonging to my religion. Current a junior at the <a href="https://www.byui.edu/about" target="_blank">Brigham Young University-Idaho</a>.</p>

                            Idaho in the CIT Department in the month of April 2022. He worked for the department for three
                            months. I was very impressed with Marvis’ ability to work with others. Marvis was not afraid to
                            speak up and raise his opinion to the team about their technical direction. In addition, he has very
                            good CSS, HTML, and Web Design skills. Marvis is also learning React Native and has a good
                            Javascript foundation. I am grateful for Marvis and the time he spent as an intern at BYUI. I
                            would recommend him to anyone.
